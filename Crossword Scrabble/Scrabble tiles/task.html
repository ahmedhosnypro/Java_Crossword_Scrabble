<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Our scrabble has 100 tiles with alphabet letters with different tile distributions. Write a program that reads the distribution of the tiles from the file and puts them in a bag in alphabetic order. The file name of the distribution file should be passed as a command-line argument, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">distribution.txt</code></pre>
<p>as the first and only argument. (Note: the actual file could be named anything, you just have to read its name from the argument)</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ul>
<li>Read the file where each line contains a letter followed by the number of tiles of that letter in the bag.</li>
<li>Put all the letters and display them on a single line. The file name for the distribution file should be passed as a command-line argument.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><em>Note that <code class="java">*</code> represents Blank/Wild tile</em></p>
