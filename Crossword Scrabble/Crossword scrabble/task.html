<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>In Scrabble, you can have 35,000 letter combinations (words) with just seven letters. To limit this range, use the power of the crossword. From the provided file, read a random line that consists of seven letters, followed by words to form and their positions, and <code class="language-python">ACR</code> or <code class="language-python">DWN</code> representing the direction.</p>
<p>For a random line, fill the cell in the crossword with letters as described in the line. The file name for the crossword scrabble file should be passed as a command-line argument â€” for example, <em>crosswordPuzzle.txt</em></p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ul>
<li>Read one random line from the file and display the content of the line on the crossword grid every time users select the <code class="language-python">Shuffle</code> command. Don't display the same line twice.</li>
<li>If <code class="language-python">Shuffle</code> is executed, and there are no lines to choose from, print <code class="language-python">No more puzzles. Bye.</code> and terminate the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>The file format is as follows - note that in the file, unlike the Place command, the coordinates of words are given in decimal format, not hexadecimal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">IDOETIN edition 5 7 ACR iodine 9 7 ACR noted 10 3 ACR ident 10 12 ACR end 7 10 ACR Tenioid 4 7 DWN

nefisdr fined 4 9 ACR fern 8 6 ACR serif 10 9 ACR Friends 4 9 DWN</code></pre>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="language-python">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
